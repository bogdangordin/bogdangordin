### Greetings! :^)

My name is Bogdan (BAWG-dhn), I'm passionate about the **Internet of Things** and I enjoy to **code**!

--- <br> 

I mostly write in **JavaScript** now days but i've delved in many other coding languages throughout the years.

For example here is a list of some stuff that I wrote, not necessarily ***mind blowing*** but ones I hold with sentimental values:

- [WordWolf](https://github.com/RFP2202-Blue-Ocean-Avengers/WordWolf) - An online web application of the game board Werewords - _JavaScript_
- [Vintage Clothing Store](https://github.com/Hunter-X-Hunter-FEC/hxh2202-atelier) (frontend) - An eCommerce website selling clothing and accessories - _JavaScript_
- [Vintage Clothing Store](https://github.com/SDC-Original-Mountain-Dew/OMD2202-sdc-atelier-overview-API) (backend) - An eCommerce server API and database containing clothing and accessories - _JavaScript_

<br>

- [Text Crypter](https://github.com/bogdangordin/file_encrypter_decrypter) - A desktop executable with command line driven menus to encrypt or decrypt .txt files - _C++_
- [Wacky Emails](https://github.com/bogdangordin/wacky_emails) - A desktop executable with command line driven menus to manage emails address from a .dat file - _Python_
- [Test Statistics](https://github.com/bogdangordin/test_statistics) - A desktop executable with command line that takes numbers and computes them - _Java_
