### Greetings! :^)

&lt;Profile README in progress&gt; My name is Bogdan (BAWG-dhn). I'm passionate about the **Internet of things** and I like to **code**.

<br>

I mostly write in **JavaScript** now days but i've delved in many other coding languages throughout the years.

For example here is a list of some stuff that I wrote, not necessarily ***mind blowing*** but ones I hold with sentimental values:

- [WordWolf](https://github.com/RFP2202-Blue-Ocean-Avengers/WordWolf) - A web application of the game board Werewords

Thank you for stopping bye!

Email me here `bogdan.gordin@gmail.com` if you're wishing to discuss, promise I don't bite (^:
